# Personality Identifier

## 🔹 Short Intro
**Personality Identifier** is a **frontend-focused React web app** that allows users to take personality tests (like **MBTI/INTJ** and **RIASEC**) and view their results interactively. The app also includes information about experts, services, mission, and a contact section—all built with a modern, responsive UI.
